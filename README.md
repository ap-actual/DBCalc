## Dependencies
If you wish to dev on this script, you will need pandas, install it either into your venv or with 
`
pip install pandas
`

## Running
To run DBCalc, simply run the exectuable main.exe. If you wish to run the actual py file, you will simply run 
`
python main.py
`

Either way, a UI should open up. Select the UDB .csv you wish to anlyse and double click on it. The program will churn for a second or two, and then output a 'OUTPUT.CSV' file with your desired output. Happy calc-ing!
